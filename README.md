# typhonjs-overview

In short TyphonJS is a platform for modern web app development focusing not only on framework concerns, but also providing fully featured pipelines for integrated container (rkt / Kubernetes) deployment built on top of JSPM / SystemJS including maintenance and monitoring solutions. In addition integrated deployment options for desktop apps via Electron is available now and Cordova is forthcoming. For web apps at the heart lies a modernized version of Backbone / [backbone-es6](https://github.com/typhonjs-backbone/backbone-es6) and related extensions for Parse ([backbone-parse-es6](https://github.com/typhonjs-backbone-parse/backbone-parse-es6)), Firebase (forthcoming), Meteor (halfway there) and SocketStream (forthcoming). The toolchain should be applicable to any web app framework that can leverage JSPM / SystemJS. TyphonJS is a multi-organization / repo effort being open sourced under the MPLv2.0 license. Please bear with us while the tooling and various framework integrations are completed. A complete TDD approach with tests for every repo along with full documentation is already availble for most repos. 

Below is an overview of all of the TyphonJS organizations / repos as of March 7th 2016. ETA of an official public launch is end of May.
